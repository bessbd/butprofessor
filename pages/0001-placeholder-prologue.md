## Placeholder Prologue
<small>Dec 18, 2015</small>

If you are looking for a prologue, you are in the right place, just not the right time (you should check back later, really)


### But Professor, there is no blog or anything without a plausible excuse. What's going on here?

This blog is no exception from all the standard rules, however according to the motto "[Release early, release often](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often)" and lean startup principles after many months of procrastination this blog came to life.

By way of introduction this blog serves two experiments. One in which a blog-engine is tested which is completely free (of cost, too), written only* in CoffeeScript and is fully static. The other experiment is one in which I try writing a blog.

Stay tuned for deep thoughts or ideas how programming can be art and some other stuff
